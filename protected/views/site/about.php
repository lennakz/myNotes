<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This Web Application made for making lists with items inside. Main purpose is shopping lists, but in future we plan to add more functionality.</p>
<p>To use this app you need to create new list and add new items. Then, after item bought, you mark this item until you buy everything you planned.</p>
<br>
<p>Hope you will enjoy using it!</p>
<p>We are working to improve it...</p>
